# California-Housing-Price-Prediction-XGBoost

Description:
This project uses the XGBoost algorithm to predict housing prices in California using the Scikit-learn California Housing dataset. Key steps and visualizations include:

* Data Exploration: Analysis of feature correlations and distributions to understand relationships within the dataset.
* XGBoost Model Training: Training an XGBoost regressor to learn patterns in the housing data.
* Evaluation: Calculation of performance metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model accuracy.
* Visualization: Plots to compare actual vs. predicted housing prices, analyze residual distributions, and examine relationships between features and target values.

Technologies:

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost
